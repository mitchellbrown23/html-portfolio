<h1>About Me</h1>

<img src="../assets/images/Mitchell Profile - White.png" height="200"/>

<p>I'm from Lexington Kentucky and I earned my Bachelor's of Science in Business Data Analytics from Western Kentucky University in 2020.</p>

<p>I've worked in tech on the marketing side for the past three years, but I've always had an interest in web development. I'm excited to continue learning on this journey.</p>

<p>I hope to one day look back at this project and be really proud of how far I've come.</p>

<p>Cheers!<br>
